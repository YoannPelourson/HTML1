          <p class="p-base ">This beer is pale, with golden hues and a touch of haze. Carbonation is very active, maintaining a good one-third inch of foam lacing on top with a bit of stick. Aroma is soft, herbal, minty and pleasant. Very smooth, with a consistent malty feel on the palate, which is interrupted by a sharp carbonation bite and followed by a lemony smack of noble hops along with a unique underlying minty leaf flavor. The sweetness on this beer is low, which is good; there's also some graininess in the back. We tasted thin citric rinds toward the finish, with a drying, lingering semi-husky grain.

          </div>
          <p class="p-base">A massive, fizzing, dense coffee-colored head rises from the pour and settles to a foam lace. Deep, rich, nearly opaque black, with ruby hues around the edges. Soft but distinct fresh coffee grounds in the nose, along with chocolate and roasted notes. Smooth, firm and even in the mouth, and not too heavy. Quite acrid up front, with a mouthful of roasted astringency, char, a sharp and semi-sour bite and a weakish watery hop flavor of the rind-like citrus variety just beneath the sourness. Minimal sweetness provides little balance, and allows the dryness of the beer to dominate. Smoky undertones. Bone-dry finish with residual roasted, stale-ish coffee grounds and acrid flavors lingering, not overly pleasant, too tannic-like.
          Dark, lovely, luscious. The deep, dark brown color hints at the flavors within. With an aroma reminiscent of chocolate and freshly baked cookies, this beer is smooth, silky, creamy, full-bodied, roasty, toasty, and slightly nutty. This is one beautifully balanced, rich, and exquisite stout.

            <p class="p-base">Ordered by the pint, the orange-colored beer shimmers with deep red and brown hues, and is topped with a healthy lace. The nose offers a very soft, mixed bag of spices and faint notes of pumpkin meat beneath some maltiness. The aroma is delicate at first, opening up as the beer warms. Carbonation is tight on the palate, a bit sharp. More soft and powdery spices emerge, reminiscent of the holidays. The pumpkin is subtle, with hints of starch. There's just enough malty sweetness as not to overwhelm the spicing or pumpkin, with an interesting bit of burnt sugar around the edges and, at times, suggestions of oranges. No real bitterness to speak of, but there's a thin sourness that awakens the palate. Some huskiness as the beer warms, with a dry finish and faint spice linger. Overall, the beer is quite dry.
